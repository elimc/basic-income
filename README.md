**Basic Income Calculator**
===========================

A public calculator that will actually attempt to put numbers to the Basic Income proposal. Over time it will grow in complexity.

**WARNING!** Changing variables in real life is very distortionary and real numbers are hard/impossible to predict. This calculator is just a good starting point to think about things.

__Can I contribute comments and suggestions to improve this calculator?__

Please. I'm not an accountant/economist, and I'm still learning jQuery. I need more variables and a better understanding of the US budget.

__Will you accept pull requests?__

If they are awesome, sure.
